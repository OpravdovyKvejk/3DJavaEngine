Current version: 3.15 Stable

A simple 3D Engine written in Java using LWJGL and OpenGL.

This project has been created thanks to YouTube tutorials.
I won't write them down though, because one might use this
code to "easily learn" them. If you want to learn from them,
watch the videos instead of copying others' code. Thanks.


The engine currently allows for:
  -Rendering a model from a list of vertices.
    -Transforming the model through the use of
    Transformation Matrices.
  -Use of GPU rendering
  -Loading textures (in the PNG format).
  -Applying a texture to a model through shaders.
  -Use of projection matrices
  -Per-Pixel Lighting
    -Specular Lighting
  -Heavy Optimization
    -Culling

What should (and WILL) be added soon-ish:
  -Heavy Optimization
    -New render code
  -Basic Terrain
  -Transparency and Fog
  -Multitexturing
  -Midmapping
  -Terrain Height Mapping
  -Collision Detection
  -A Texture Atlas
  -GUI Rendering
  -More Lights
    -Point Lights
  -Skybox
    -Day/Night
  -Using the Mouse (in menus, etc.)
  -Cel Shading
  -Normal Mapping
  -Font Rendering
  -Distance Field Text Rendering
  -Particles
    -Animated Particle Textures
  -Instanced Rendering
  -Procedural Terrain
  -Shadow Mapping
  -Percentage Closer Filtering
  -Anti-aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering
  -Post Processing
  -Gaussian Blur
  -Multisampled FBOs
  -Specular Maps
  -Bloom
  -Multiple Render Targets
  -Cube Map Reflections
  -More


  PS. Yes, I DO realize how inefficient the rendering process
  is so far - I will fix that soon-ish.
