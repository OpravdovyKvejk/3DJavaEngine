Current version: 3.3 Stable

A simple 3D Engine written in Java using LWJGL and OpenGL.

This project has been created thanks to YouTube tutorials
and the official LWJGL documentation.
I won't write the tutorials down though, because one might use
this code to "easily learn" them. If you want to learn from
them, watch the videos instead of copying and pasting others' 
code. Thanks.


The engine currently allows for:
1.0
  -Rendering a model from a list of vertices.
    -Transforming the model through the use of
    Transformation Matrices.
  -Use of GPU rendering
2.0
  -Loading textures (in the PNG format).
  -Applying a texture to a model through shaders.
  -Use of projection matrices
3.0
  -Per-Pixel Lighting
3.15
    -Specular Lighting
3.2
  -Heavy Optimization
    -Culling
	-New render code
3.3
  -Basic Terrain
